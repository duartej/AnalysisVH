The AnalysisVH package is intended to be used to get yields,plots, cross-sections and its systematic uncertainties and some other issues related with, in principle, any analysis in CMS with multilepton final state. So far, there are implemented the WZ and WH (3-lepton) analysis. Note that this package is highly specific, it needs very specific pre-processed inputs (data samples obtained from the CMS collaboration  which are private data).

The AnalysisVH package is self-consistent and there is no need for the CMSSW framework (of course you will need a ROOT distribution installed > 5.30, lesser releases could work but it has been not tested). The package assumes as input root files with a Tree containing plain and/or C++ standard containers leaves.

The main features of the package are:
* Provides a framework for a cut-based multilepton final state analysis for the different run periods of CMS.
* Flexibility in the leptonic objects definitions and analysis cuts via configuration files
* Provides a suite of utilities to easily extract results getting final yields, tables, plots, cross-section values and so on.
* Incorporates some utilities to manage the process of massive launching of datasamples using a computing cluster (IFCA and UO clusters)

The package usage is described in [Analysis instructions](https://github.com/duartej/AnalysisVH/wiki/Analysis-instructions) documentation page. Also, if you want to develop or improve the code you should read the [Package description](https://github.com/duartej/AnalysisVH/wiki/AnalysisVH-package-description) documentation in order to familiarize with the design and structure of the code.
