********************

Nov. 9th 2011 --  Tag release v0.1 : First version working
  * Synchronised with original-PROOF code (IFCA-UO/WH  MAIN r1.11)
  * Found a bug in PROOF's code: line 566 'imuon' should be 'i' (r1.12)
Nov. 10th 2011--  Tag release v0.2 : Freeze version with MiniTrees (before change to Latinos)
  * Improved sendcluster utility (to send analysis to cluster and gather the outputs)
  * Added haddPlus utility, hadd improved version to deal with InputParamters and TCounterUI
    objects
  * Fixed some methods in order to make the plot utilities work with the outputs
Nov. 11th 2011--  Tag release v0.3 : First version with Latinos
  * TreeManager include electron methods
Nov. 13th 2011--  Tag release v1.0 : Analysis independence of the final state
  * AnalysisVH (will be) base class for a concrete final state analysis, independently of 
  the final state signature
  * TreeManager extracts directly the data members of a TChain without build the Tree structure
  of a file. TO BE DEPRECATED: 
                              - wrappers methods to get the datamembers of a TChain
			      - construction of the TreeManagerMiniTrees code, and as consequence
			      there will be no longer need to launch the datamanagercreator (it will
			      be renamed to extractdatafiles or something like that)
Nov. 16th 2011--  Tag release v2.0 : Deprecated selector dependence of each file
  * Not needed to created a selector specific for each data file, getting directly the values via
  the name of the branch. It slows the process a factor 2. Nevertheless, it introduces clarity and
  do not break the workflow creating a selector for each file (or group of files), also portability
  between the different types of ntuples. It takes ~20m to process ~1.1M when the v01.00 took ~7m to
  process ~1.1M of events.
Nov. 19th 2011-- Tag release v02.01: Included the mixing signatures
  * Still missing deep checks, but shows reasonable results


TODO:
  1a.Change the data files to be used depending the lepton final state when use data 
  1. Incorporate the latino's trees ----> DONE
  2. Incorporate (create) an electron analysis ---> DONE
  3. Incorporate (create) a lepton analysis  ---> DONE
  5. Check with the *.sh.e* the good behaviour of the job
  6. Resume the outputs of the jobs (mainly the final table) --> DONE
  7. Include a Jet plot (before the Jet Veto cut)
