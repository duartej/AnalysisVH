********************

Nov. 9th 2011 --  Tag release v0.1 : First version working
  * Synchronised with original-PROOF code (IFCA-UO/WH  MAIN r1.11)
  * Found a bug in PROOF's code: line 566 'imuon' should be 'i' (r1.12)
Nov. 10th 2011--  Tag release v0.2 : Freeze version with MiniTrees (before change to Latinos)
  * Improved sendcluster utility (to send analysis to cluster and gather the outputs)
  * Added haddPlus utility, hadd improved version to deal with InputParamters and TCounterUI
    objects
  * Fixed some methods in order to make the plot utilities work with the outputs
Nov. 11th 2011--  Tag release v0.3 : First version with Latinos
  * TreeManager include electron methods
Nov. 13th 2011--  Tag release v1.0 : Analysis independence of the final state
  * AnalysisVH (will be) base class for a concrete final state analysis, independently of 
  the final state signature
  * TreeManager extracts directly the data members of a TChain without build the Tree structure
  of a file. TO BE DEPRECATED: 
                              - wrappers methods to get the datamembers of a TChain
			      - construction of the TreeManagerMiniTrees code, and as consequence
			      there will be no longer need to launch the datamanagercreator (it will
			      be renamed to extractdatafiles or something like that)
Nov. 16th 2011--  Tag release v2.0 : Deprecated selector dependence of each file
  * Not needed to created a selector specific for each data file, getting directly the values via
  the name of the branch. It slows the process a factor ~2.3. Nevertheless, it introduces clarity and
  do not break the workflow creating a selector for each file (or group of files), also portability
  between the different types of ntuples. It takes ~20m to process ~1.1M when the v01.00 took ~7m to
  process ~1.1M of events.
Nov. 19th 2011-- Tag release v02.01: Included the mixing signatures
  * Still missing deep checks, but shows reasonable results
Nov. 25th 2011-- Tag release v03.00: Included the AnalysisBase class
  * Each concrete analysis inherits from AnalysisBase which take account the interaction with the data
  * It is needed to virtualize some methods in AnalysisBase in order to let choose the concrete analysis
  what wants to store
Dec. 19th 2011-- Tag release v04.00: WZ analysis stable
  * Deep cleaning of WZ analysis and incorporation of new cuts (dR internal bremsstralung). Results show
  good agreement data-MC (see WZ2011_MCFall11 dir)
  * CutLevels is promoted to a package (out of WH_Analysis), the class keeps the cuts order of every 
  analysis.
  * Deprecated TResultsTable package in favor of printtable.py script
  * Analysis workflow up to now:
     1. Call 'datamanagercreator -r <2011|2011A|2011B> -f <mmm|mme|eem|eee>' to create the 
     datafiles containing the path to the root files (Name_datanames.dn)
     2. Create a directory for each final state
     3. Launch 'sendall.sh' script (not yet in this repository, to be incorporated soon)
     4. Collect all outputs with 'collectall.sh' script (not yet in this repo)
     5. Merge all final states into the one (lepton final state) using 'merge3leptonsfs -d dirch1,dirch2,...'
     6. Do the plots using 'plotall.sh' (not yet in this repo)
   You can see what are the actual process call in each script


TODO:
  B. Include the Z+Jets madgraph (including also the needed modifications in the code
     to avoid doble counting, see Ana's email)
  5. Check with the *.sh.e* the good behaviour of the job
  9. Put in the configuration the Working Point to be used in the Electrons
  12.Generalize the sendcluster script such a way it was able to send any kind of cluster job, not only the 
     runanalysis job
  14.Include a 'resubmit' argument to sendcluster
  15.Promote to 'Utils' the plotall.sh collectall.sh and sendall.sh scripts (just is needed an argument defining the 
     kind of signal used)
