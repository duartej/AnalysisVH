Nov. 9th 2011 --  Tag release v0.1 : First version working
  * Synchronised with original-PROOF code (IFCA-UO/WH  MAIN r1.11)
  * Found a bug in PROOF's code: line 566 'imuon' should be 'i' (r1.12)
Nov. 10th 2011--  Tag release v0.2 : Freeze version with MiniTrees (before change to Latinos)
  * Improved sendcluster utility (to send analysis to cluster and gather the outputs)
  * Added haddPlus utility, hadd improved version to deal with InputParamters and TCounterUI
    objects
  * Fixed some methods in order to make the plot utilities work with the outputs
Nov. 11th 2011--  Tag release v0.3 : First version with Latinos
  * TreeManager include electron methods
Nov. 13th 2011--  Tag release v1.0 : Analysis independence of the final state
  * AnalysisVH (will be) base class for a concrete final state analysis, independently of 
  the final state signature
  * TreeManager extracts directly the data members of a TChain without build the Tree structure
  of a file. TO BE DEPRECATED: 
                              - wrappers methods to get the datamembers of a TChain
			      - construction of the TreeManagerMiniTrees code, and as consequence
			      there will be no longer need to launch the datamanagercreator (it will
			      be renamed to extractdatafiles or something like that)



TODO:
  1a.Change the data files to be used depending the lepton final state when use data 
  1. Incorporate the latino's trees ----> DONE
  2. Incorporate (create) an electron analysis ---> DONE
  3. Incorporate (create) a lepton analysis  
  4. Use directly the tree->GetLeaf("nameofthebranch")->GetValue(index) (index=0 if there is no vector) --> DONE
     Checks:
             * How much time is this slowing down the reading process?
	     * Is the amount of time aceptable?
  5. Check with the *.sh.e* the good behaviour of the job
  6. Resume the outputs of the jobs (mainly the final table)
