      - Synchronization with IRB group:
        + Muon loose definition iso moved from 0.4 to 1.0
	+ Blacklist events which should be dropped because some processing
	filters
      - New mass window M_Z+-20
      - Added ZZ Powheg inclusive samples, deprecating the inclusive madgraph
   * Management improvements:

      a more gneral and powerful subtractor
      - deprecated TResultsTable
      - new processedsample class, starting point of each analysis processed
      output file
      - script to delete jobs
      - improved sendcluster script allowing resubmision of jobs and better
      output control
      - systematic is attached to a working directory, instead of being a
      python module. They are calculated every time it needs
      - sendall and collect incorporates the sending and collecting of the
      systematic

Jun. 14th 2012-- Tag release v04.03: Changed default FR matrices. Cosmethics improvements
   * Analysis improvements:
      - Nominals FR matrices: (muons and electrons)
        + ZJets (before MET cut): 35 (30-muons 'cause do not have it)
	+ ttbar (after MET cut): 50
      - Included PPP (ZZ and WZ) substraction to the Fake estimation
      - Included the check: at least one lepton pass the higher-pt trigger requirement  (when
        AtLeast3Leptons level)
      - Included the VGamma (Zgamma + Wgamma) sample 
      - Changed to the [71,111] mass range of Z (PDG-mass +-20)
      - Using BLUE method to calculate a combined cross-section
   * Management improvements:
      - WManager class manage all kind of factors to be weighted in an event (scale factors, fake
        rates, ...). Deprecated the FOManager
      - Almost all post-processors scripts moved to python 
      - python scripts which can be used as modules (via import) and contain useful functions 
        or classes are names as: 'somename_mod.py' and they are installed in the system (launching
	the setup script, it is possible to use them)	
      - Added several scripts:
        + Utils/promptsubstract.py   Extract PPP contribution to the Fakes samples. Also creates a
	                             warning file inside the modified 'cluster_Fakes' directory 
				     where the raw numbers before the substraction are there
	+ Utils/plothistopy.py       New python script to plot (instead the old .cc one)
	+ Utils/xscalc.py            Cross-section calculation script
	+ Utils/bluemethod.py        Calculation of combined cross-section with the BLUE method
	+ Utils/LatinoStyle_mod.py   Default cosmethics style (it could be used as python module) 
	+ Utils/functionspool_mod.py Pool of useful functions (it could be used as python module)
	+ Utils/systematics_mod.py   Centralized module where to put the systematics values
	+ Utils/kstest.py            Do a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (very dependent of the input files)
	+ Utils/setZgammaXS.py       Provisional script to deal with the incorrect cross-section 
	                             quoted in the spreadsheet for the VGamma samples	                             
        + Utils/pdfsystematics.cc    Calculate the systematic due to the PDF (not final version yet)
      - A lot of cosmethics improvements

Apr. 03rd 2012-- Tag release v04.02: Scale factors incorporation and changes in default sample definitions
   * Analysis improvements:
      - Incorporated the WManager class which controls the scale factors (and ideally whatever 
        efficiency related. So it would superseed the FOManager class, but still not solve some
	problems so FOManager is still working): Inclusion of scale factors
      - WZ Analysis has changed the pre-selection cut from require AT LEAST 3 leptons to 
        EXACTLY 3 leptons
      - BDT based-id electrons included in the analysis, removing the cut-based id electrons
      - Changed WZ sample to be an exclusive (fully leptonic) Madgraph (Fall11)
      - Changed (in all the places where required) the default luminosity to the new value: 4922.0pb-1
   * Management improvements: 
      - Shown in the harvesting process (or standard output of runanalysis) the number of muons
        and electrons whose where selected as no Tight in the Fake sample
      - Changed default ouput format to .pdf
      - New script 'getsystematics' to extract the relative differences of several samples (to be 
        used as systematic extraction)
      - New output table format, more compact, besides the old one. Added a new column which shown
        Nobs-Nbkg

Feb. 08th 2012-- Tag release v04.01: Improvements in the analysis and Fakes incorporation
   * Analysis improvements: 
      - Anti internal breamsstraulhung cut
      - Z and W candidate cut levels (in WZ analysis)
   * Management improvements:
      - New scripts for send, collect all the samples at once
      - New histograms added
   * Fakes incorporation:  it is possible to extract a first estimation of fake background using 
   the new -F option in runanalysis. The estimation is done assuming:
      1. p = 1 (prompt ratio)
      2. TTnT ---> nT ==> weight per event: f/(1-f) where f=f(pt,eta) of the noTight lepton of the
         event
      - The manager of this new functionality is FOManager class
      - Also, added new options to the sendcluster, plothisto, printable, ... scripts to deal with
        this new mode 

Nov. 16th 2011--  Tag release v2.0 : Deprecated selector dependence of each file
  * Not needed to created a selector specific for each data file, getting directly the values via
  the name of the branch. It slows the process a factor ~2.3. Nevertheless, it introduces clarity and
  do not break the workflow creating a selector for each file (or group of files), also portability
  between the different types of ntuples. It takes ~20m to process ~1.1M when the v01.00 took ~7m to
  process ~1.1M of events.
Nov. 19th 2011-- Tag release v02.01: Included the mixing signatures
  * Still missing deep checks, but shows reasonable results
Nov. 25th 2011-- Tag release v03.00: Included the AnalysisBase class
  * Each concrete analysis inherits from AnalysisBase which take account the interaction with the data
  * It is needed to virtualize some methods in AnalysisBase in order to let choose the concrete analysis
  what wants to store
Dec. 19th 2011-- Tag release v04.00: WZ analysis stable
  * Deep cleaning of WZ analysis and incorporation of new cuts (dR internal bremsstralung). Results show
  good agreement data-MC (see WZ2011_MCFall11 dir)
  * CutLevels is promoted to a package (out of WH_Analysis), the class keeps the cuts order of every 
  analysis.
  * Deprecated TResultsTable package in favor of printtable.py script
  * Analysis workflow up to now:
     1. Call 'datamanagercreator -r <2011|2011A|2011B> -f <mmm|mme|eem|eee>' to create the 
     datafiles containing the path to the root files (Name_datanames.dn)
     2. Create a directory for each final state
     3. Launch 'sendall SIGNAL', where SIGNAL=WZ or WH
     4. Collect all outputs with 'collectall SIGNAL'
     5. Merge all final states into the one (lepton final state) using 'merge3leptonsfs -d dirch1,dirch2,...'
     6. Do the plots and merge all final states using 'plotall SIGNAL' where SIGNAL can be WHnnn or WZ.
        nnn is the mass hypothesis
   You can see what are the actual process calling in each script

Nov. 10th 2011--  Tag release v0.2 : Freeze version with MiniTrees (before change to Latinos)
  * Improved sendcluster utility (to send analysis to cluster and gather the outputs)
  * Added haddPlus utility, hadd improved version to deal with InputParamters and TCounterUI
    objects
  * Fixed some methods in order to make the plot utilities work with the outputs
Nov. 11th 2011--  Tag release v0.3 : First version with Latinos
  * TreeManager include electron methods
Nov. 13th 2011--  Tag release v1.0 : Analysis independence of the final state
  * AnalysisVH (will be) base class for a concrete final state analysis, independently of 
  the final state signature
  * TreeManager extracts directly the data members of a TChain without build the Tree structure
  of a file. TO BE DEPRECATED: 
                              - wrappers methods to get the datamembers of a TChain
			      - construction of the TreeManagerMiniTrees code, and as consequence
			      there will be no longer need to launch the datamanagercreator (it will
			      be renamed to extractdatafiles or something like that)

Nov. 9th 2011 --  Tag release v0.1 : First version working
  * Synchronised with original-PROOF code (IFCA-UO/WH  MAIN r1.11)
  * Found a bug in PROOF's code: line 566 'imuon' should be 'i' (r1.12)
